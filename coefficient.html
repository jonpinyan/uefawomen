<title>UEFA Women's Coefficient System</title>
</head>
<body><h2>How the Coefficient System Works</h2>

The good news is that there is only one point system in operation at a time in the women's game. Unlike the men's coefficients, there are not different ways in which qualifying results are counted for the team coefficient vs the association coefficient. The bad news is that I suspect that symmetry will cease when the second club competition is introduced for 2025-26. But in any event, here's how points are and have been awarded in the UEFA Women's Champions League.<p>

<h3>2021-22 through 2024-25</h3>
For teams eliminated in round one, they are awarded points based on their finish in the four-team mini-tournament they played. Fourth place gets 1 point, third place gets 1.5, and the runner-up gets 2 points. Therefore, all teams competing earn at least 1 point, and all nations that send a team earn at least 1 point for their ranking. Teams drawn into a three-team tournament have the advantage that you can't be fourth place in a three-team tournament, and are guaranteed at least 1.5 points.<br>
All teams eliminated in round two receive 3 points.<p>
Teams that reach the group stage get 4 points for qualifying. Then, they earn 2 points for every win and 1 point for every draw in the group stage. The teams that reach the quarterfinal earn 1 bonus point.<p>
In the knockout rounds, teams continue to earn 2 points for each win and 1 point for each draw, plus an additional 1 bonus point for winning a series and advancing to the next round. <font color=red>This means there are effectively 5 points up for grabs in every home-and-away series. A team earns 5 for two wins; 4 for a win and a draw; 3 for winning a series with a win and a loss or with two draws; 2 for losing a series with a win and a loss or with two draws; 1 for a loss and a draw; 0 for two losses.</font><br>
The final is a single game, which merely awards 2 for a win and 1 to each team if it goes to penalties, with no additional bonus to the champion.

<h3>2020-21</h3>
In lieu of four-team qualifying groups, the qualifying stage was held as two rounds of single-leg matches. All teams eliminated in round one earned 1 point, and all teams eliminated in round two earned 2 points.<p>
Teams that reached the round of 32, either as their starting place or by winning round two, received 3 points. Then, each of the four home-and-away knockout rounds are scored on the 5-point system described above, followed by the single-game final.

<h3>2009-10 through 2019-20</h3>
Qualifying was held in four-team centralized groups. In some years, there were wild cards available to the best-ranking runner-ups. For teams that did not advance, they earned 1 point for each win and 0.5 points for each draw during their three-game qualifying round. This means that several teams (and consequently several countries) earned 0 points for their participation in that season's UWCL.<p>
Teams that reached the round of 32, either as their starting place, by winning their group, or being a high-finishing runner-up, received 3 points. Then, each of the four home-and-away knockout rounds are scored on the 5-point system described above, followed by the single-game final.<br>
In 2020, the competition was suspended due to COVID before the quarterfinals. The quarterfinals and semifinals of the competition were held in August as single-leg neutral-site games. For each of these games, the winner received 4 points and the loser 1, effectively treating the series as having a second game that was drawn. Had any of the games been decided on penalties, the winning team would have received 3 points (2 for the draw + 1 for advancing) and the losing team 2. These games are indicated with a * in tables on this site.

<h3>2025-26 and onward</h3>
The coefficient system that will be used under the new league system launching in 2025-26 has not been announced, and will likely appear in March or April 2025.

<h3>The Association Coefficient</h3>
For each season of UWCL competition, a national association is awarded the average of the points earned by all their competing teams. For instance, in 2023-24, England had three entries. Chelsea reached the semifinals and earned 21 points. Manchester United lost in round two and earned 3 points. Arsenal lost the final of their round one tournament and earned 2 points. Thus England earns 26 / 3 = 8.666 points. Note that, by rule, the quotient is truncated (not rounded) to the third decimal place.<p>
Five years' worth of these averages are summed to determine the national rankings. The 2024 rankings incorporate results from the 2019-20 through 2023-24 seasons. They are then used to determine the number of qualifying teams, and the round of entry for those teams, for the 2025-26 UEFA season, based on the results of that nation's league in the 2024-25 (or 2024, for summer leagues) season.

<h3>The Club Coefficient</h3>
Each team's coefficient is calculated by summing their last five season's point totals. Then, 20% of their nation's association coefficient is added. This means that, given two teams with similar past results (or no past results), the team from the stronger country will rank higher. Coefficients are used to seed teams in the preliminary rounds, as well as to determine pots 2, 3, and 4 for the group stage, while pot 1 consists of the four teams with direct access to the group stage.

<h3>Lastly, a Math Teacher's Complaint</h3>
Dear UEFA: That isn't what the word <i>coefficient</i> means.
